This is a simple script to bulk download an (properly annotated) gene from genbank, from single loci or WGS/NGS data.

Simply prepare a list of genbank accessions (~gene Id) which looks like genesID.txt; first line must be gene [name of gene], following lines must contain only one Accession number per line.
